# Movie recommendation platform

Analysis of movie data and movie recommendations based on the IMDb database.

The first part of the project aimed at exploring and cleaning the IMDb database to keep only a selection of movies (cf. screenshots below). Figures were created with Plotly Chart Studio.

The second step was the creation of a web app for a cinema owner that displays movie information and recommendations of similar movies (cf. screenshots below). 
It builds on the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend movies based on similar features (e.g. genre, release date, popularity).

This work is a group project led at Wild Code School (Oct-Nov 2021).
