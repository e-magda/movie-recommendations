# Movie recommendation platform

App with movie recommendations based on the IMDb database.

The first part of the project aimed at exploring and cleaning the IMDb database to keep only a selection of movies.

The second step was the creation of a web app that displays movie informations and recommendations of similar movies. 
It builds on the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend movies based on similar features (e.g. genre, release date, popularity).

This work is a team project led at Wild Code School (Oct-Nov 2021).
