Through the eyes and voice of Hunter, we follow how she grows up from being a 6 week old fox cub to raising cubs of her own. Filmmakers Ana Luisa Santos and Michael Sanderson followed and filmed these red foxes in the Dutch nature reserve Oostvaardersplassen. In this rare wildlife film, where every animal you see is 100% wild and free from manipulation, we delve into secret lives of truly wild foxes. Here they live and behave in a world without humans where they are the top predators and scavenge carcasses of large herbivores. Hunter hunts geese with high speed chases and Red shows his paternal tenderness towards his newborn cubs. We get to know the three siblings who take different paths in becoming adults. Come and take a journey inside the skin of Hunter, who will show you her side of the story in her wild fox life.']",tt6203844,tt2461906,tt2234537,tt3246158,,https://Trailers.to/player/embed/imdb/tt10342460

With the help of Zin, a lovers\' go-between, he meets the beautiful Aziz, Princess of Samarkand. After encountering wars, a battle between false prophets and an ancient curse, he learns that an entire lifetime would not suffice for him to learn the many dimensions of love. Tunisian director Nacer Khemir, also a poet, painter and professional storyteller, notes: ""The film takes place in Moslem Andalusia of the 11th century. But it\'s not a question of reconstituting a given time and place, but rather of summoning up the reflection of a forgotten garden, and out of a yearning for peace, so difficult to protect from barbarians and from destructive fanaticisms. Andalusia has been the meeting place of many cultures, a living dialog of the peoples and religions whose traces can still be deciphered in texts, music and gardens all the way from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. This is not an Andalusian love story, but Andalusia as the very essence of love, through its perfumes, poetry and gardens.""']",tt0103262,tt0115740,tt0104606,tt0098684,,https://Trailers.to/player/embed/imdb/tt0101600

He dreamed of growing up and working for the Canadiens franchise. But a more immediate goal was to get tickets to one of their games, using M.

He also remembers his school life from that year, with the arrival of pot smoking free thinking hippie Ron Richardson as the new English teacher, and dreading home room with strict Mlle.
