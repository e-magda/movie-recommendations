Directed and shot by Daniel Lombroso in his directorial debut, this film takes the viewer into the terrifying heart of the movement -- explosive protests, riotous parties, and the rooms where populist and racist ideologies are refined, weaponized, and injected into the mainstream. Just as the alt-right comes to prominence, infighting tears the movement apart. Spencer and Cernovich clash over the role of white nationalism in conservative politics. Southern struggles to reconcile her leadership role with the sexism and misogyny of her peers. Lawsuits mount and internecine fights erupt, but even as the alt-right fractures, its once-marginalized ideas find a foothold in mainstream discourse; in Republican politics; in the establishment right-wing press, especially Fox News -- and on the world's biggest social-media platforms. As white-nationalist violence surges in America and across the world, White Noise represents an urgent warning about the power of extremism, and where it's going next.::The Atlantic""]",tt13615386,tt11863046,tt12724622,tt11394184,https://www.youtube.com/embed/HncFO8Sujvk,https://Trailers.to/player/embed/imdb/tt12569462
